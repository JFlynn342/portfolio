Meowtations is a platformer I developed with a small team over the summer of 2020. Although it was never finished, 
it still serves as a strong testament to my Unity experience. As one of the two programmers on the team, I implemented
several of the game's key features, including the player's movement and the health icons that disappear when damage is taken.
The fact that enemy projectiles are fired at a height and rate that makes them essentialy unavoidable was meant to be taken care of,
but the start of the fall semester caused us to abandon the project altogether in order to focus on other commitments.


Woods of Woe is a turn-based RPG that I created with a partner from scratch in C++ as part of one of my game development courses.
During its development, I implemented all of the combat mechanics and systems. During the first five weeks of the course, we worked
on building the "Dragonfly" engine that the game runs on, while the last two weeks were spent making the game itself.
